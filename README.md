# Draggable text objects on HTML canvas
##A function for creating a draggable text object on HTML canvas

The program provides function by which users can customize a piece of text and display the text on the HTML canvas or drag the text object in the area of the canvas. There are two versions of the function. In first version, users can select a font from generic font families which include serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive and fantasy. On the other hand, the font families in the second version can be selected from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/). The collection of font families is the difference between these two verions.
