# Draggable text objects on HTML canvas
## A function for creating a draggable text object on HTML canvas

The program provides the function by which users can customize a piece of text and display the text on the HTML canvas or drag the text object around within the area of the canvas. There are two versions of the function. The first version gives users generic font families that they can choose from, which include *serif*, *sans-serif*, *monospace*, *cursive* and *fantasy*. On the other hand, the font families in the second version can be selected from *Google Fonts* (https://fonts.google.com/). Besides the difference on the collection of font families, the first version also comes with a randomizing function which can randomize the postions of the text objects on the canvas when users press the key "r" on their keyboard.

The latest code of the first version is on the master branch, which outcome is shown as figure 1.
